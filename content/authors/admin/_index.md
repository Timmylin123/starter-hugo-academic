Hello! My name is **Ting-Han Lin**, and I go by **Timmy**. I am currently an interaction designer and HRI researcher at the University of Chicago advised by Prof. Sarah Sebo and Prof. Ken Nakagaki. I received both M.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from the University of Chicago in 2022 (*[4-year Joint BA/MS in Computer Science](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/jointdegreecomsci/)*). Before coming to the United States for college, I was born and raised in Taiwan.

My research interest lies in the intersection of **multi-robot team control** and **human-robot interaction**. Specifically, I design **intelligent robotic systems** with a research goal to better integrate robots into our world by (1) facilitating new forms of human-robot interaction, (2) making robots more accessible, programmable, and interactive with people, and (3) showing people the intelligence of robots.

Two of my research projects investigated the potentiality of employing robots as game masters in interactive games and using robots as ice-breakers in group settings. One of my projects allows users to spatially throw and catch objects between the digital and the physical worlds via a swarm user interface.

Soon, I envision our future living environment will be accompanied by many intelligent robotic systems, and I am excited to research into how groups of people can interact with various forms of robots.
