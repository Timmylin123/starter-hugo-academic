Hello! My name is **Ting-Han Lin**, and I go by **Timmy**. I am a computer science PhD student advised by [Prof. Sarah Sebo](https://sarahsebo.com/) at the University of Chicago. I received both M.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from the University of Chicago in 2022 (*[4-year Joint BA/MS in Computer Science](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/jointdegreecomsci/)*). During my master's and undergrad, I was advised by [Prof. Sarah Sebo](https://sarahsebo.com/) and [Prof. Ken Nakagaki](https://www.ken-nakagaki.com/). Before coming to the United States for college, I was born and raised in Taiwan.

My research interest lies in the intersection of **human-robot interaction** and **human-computer interaction**. Specifically, I focus on designing **user-adaptive social robots**. As social robots become more prevalent, they will need to adapt to multiple users' preferences and avoid relying on scripted verbal responses and actions. I develop robots capable of managing group dynamics, supporting user-initiated interaction, and ensuring long-term user engagement. My work contributes to the future of companion robots with greater adaptivity and accessibility. I have published my research in top conferences including HRI, CHI, and RO-MAN.
