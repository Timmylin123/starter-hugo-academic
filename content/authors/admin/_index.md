Hello! My name is **Ting-Han Lin**. I usually go by **Timmy**. I am currently a HRI researcher at the University of Chicago. I received both M.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from the University of Chicago in 2022 (*[4-year Joint BA/MS in Computer Science](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/jointdegreecomsci/)*). Before coming to the United States for college, I was born and raised in Taiwan.

My research interest lies in the intersection of **swarm user interface** and **human-robot interaction**. I design and build swarm user interfaces to facilitate novel interactions between humans and robots. One of my research projects allows users to spatially throw and catch objects between the digital and the physical worlds with a swarm user interface. I also seek to bring people closer to robots by (1) facilitating new forms of human-robot interaction, (2) making robots more accessible, programmable, and interactive with people, and (3) letting people know robots are intelligent companions that have the potential to do many tasks. Two of my research projects have investigated the potentiality of employing robots as game masters in interactive games and using robots as ice-breakers in group settings. Soon, I envision our future living environment will be accompanied by many robotic systems, so it is imperative to extend knowledge to see how groups of people can interact with groups of robots.
