Hello! My name is **Ting-Han Lin**, and I go by **Timmy**. I am a computer science PhD student advised by [Prof. Sarah Sebo](https://sarahsebo.com/) at the University of Chicago. I received both M.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from the University of Chicago in 2022 (*[4-year Joint BA/MS in Computer Science](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/jointdegreecomsci/)*). During my master's and undergrad, I was advised by [Prof. Sarah Sebo](https://sarahsebo.com/) and [Prof. Ken Nakagaki](https://www.ken-nakagaki.com/). Before coming to the United States for college, I was born and raised in Taiwan.

My research interest lies in the intersection of **human-robot interaction** and **human-computer interaction**. Specifically, I design **intelligent robotic systems** with a research goal to better integrate robots into our world by (1) facilitating new forms of human-robot interaction, (2) making robots more accessible, programmable, and interactive with people, and (3) showing people the capability of robots as intelligent supporters. I have published my research in top conferences including HRI, CHI, and RO-MAN.

Soon, I envision our future living environment will be accompanied by many intelligent robotic systems, and I am excited to research how groups of people can interact with various forms of robots.
