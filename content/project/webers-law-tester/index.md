**Weber’s law**, also called **Weber-Fechner law**, is historically important psychological law quantifying the perception of change in a given stimulus. The law states that the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus. It has been shown not to hold for extremes of stimulation.

I used python to design a Weber's Law Tester. My program contains 10 mini sections. Once you start to run my program, you will follow a series of prompts on the terminal that ask you to select "which plot has more dots"? In the end, you will see a study result from the Weber's Law Tester.

Here is my [python code](https://github.com/tinghanlin/webers-law-tester) for my program! Feel free to check it out!! You can download my folder, go to my folder, and run “*python webers-law-tester.py”* and see if you conform with Weber's Law!
