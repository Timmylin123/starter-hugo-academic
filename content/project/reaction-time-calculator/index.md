I designed an interactive program with Python that allows a player to test his or her reaction time.

Once a player starts my interactive program, the terminal prompts will ask him or her to press the ENTER key when they see the word **PIKACHU.** My program would test a player's reaction time for 30 trials and give summary results of reaction time in the end. Notice that the reaction time measured in my program is the time when a player sees the word **PIKACHU** to the time him or her hit the ENTER key on the keyboard.

Here is a [video demo](https://youtu.be/gTwu_zLv1l8) of myself testing my reaction time. Here is the [python code](https://github.com/tinghanlin/reaction-time-calculator) for my interactive program! Feel free to git clone my folder and run “python reaction-time-calculator.py” in my folder to launch the program!
