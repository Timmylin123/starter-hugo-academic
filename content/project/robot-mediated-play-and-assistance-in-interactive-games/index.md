**Abstract:**

We introduced a social robot to an interactive puzzle game where the robot served as an in-game character that is both a cooperative partner and a “game master.” Human players needed to ask the in-game character for information to com- plete tasks and had the option to ask for hints to solve puzzles. We investigated how players’ game experiences would differ when this in-game character is changed from a robot to a human actor and vice versa, and we conducted a between- subjects study (𝑛 = 25) with both conditions. Our results showed that participants playing with a robot had more fun, felt more comfortable and less awkward, and made more progress in solving the tasks compared to those playing with a human. These results suggest that robots can effectively replace humans in broader contexts such as immersive en- tertainment spaces (e.g. escape rooms) to provide greater enjoyment and encourage more interaction.
