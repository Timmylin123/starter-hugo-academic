A sneaky little EV charger dashboard hosted on Render that lets you peek at real-time availability at secret Chicago spots (shh...ask Timmy). No more checking chargers in-person or clicking through boring links. Now these chargers just show up in one handy page with timestamped updates and a refresh button. Behind the scenes, a clever Flask backend fetches the info from the EVPassport API, so you get fast updates without ever revealing the magic to your browser.
