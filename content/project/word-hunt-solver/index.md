Word Hunt is an 80-second minigame developed by [Game Pigeon](http://gamepigeonapp.com/). A player is given 16 letters on a 4x4 grid, then he will have to find out word combinations from those letters. Words can be formed in any direction but they have to be on a straight line with each letter being adjacent to the following letter in the way the word is spelled. This game is played by 2 people through text messages. The winner is the person who got the most word combo after time is passed.

I used python to design a program that can solve Word Hunt within 1 second! Just by inserting the 16 letters shown in the Word Hunt game row by row from left to right into the text bar, my program would automatically show you all of the vocabulary words that can be formed by these letters (refer to the screenshot above). Then, you can beat your opponent every time!

Here is my [python code](https://github.com/tinghanlin/wordhunt-solver) for my program! Feel free to check it out!! You can download my folder, go to my folder, and run “*python WordHuntSolver.py”* and try it out yourself!
