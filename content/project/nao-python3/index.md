We can finally control NAO robot in Python3! This repository contains the nao_demo.py script, demonstrating a simplified NAO interaction with a user from Experiment 1 in The Impact of a Robot's Agreement (or Disagreement) on Human-Human Interpersonal Closeness in a Two-Person Decision-Making Task. This code is written in Python3, and NAO's actions are controlled by qi library.
