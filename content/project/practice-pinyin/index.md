A fast, lightweight game for practicing Mandarin pinyin through timed character recall. Players type the correct pinyin for randomly selected Traditional Chinese characters, receive immediate feedback, and review mistakes with correct answers at the end of each round. The game tracks commonly missed characters locally and ensures each round presents unique characters, making it ideal for quick practice sessions or shared use across multiple players.
