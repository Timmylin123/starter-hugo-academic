College students often frustrated with tracking social events from many media sources (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, University Emails). They are also frustrated with finding events that are happening near their physical location and finding the locations of these events. To solve these problems, I made an Event Tracker app prototype using inVision. This app prototype collects private and public event information from many media sources and shows the events altogether in a map-style display. Here is the [link](https://invis.io/4P11YSGNF8RU) to view my prototype.
