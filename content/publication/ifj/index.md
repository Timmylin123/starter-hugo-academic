abstract: No longer just a relic of science fiction movies, autonomous cars have become a reality. Autonomous cars are heavily researched and developed by both large technology companies and traditional car manufacturers.Within a couple of years, autonomous cars will be able to transport people from one place to another on a massive scale. However, their emergence would actually lead to safety concerns and umemployment crisis. With these drawbacks in mind, would autonomous cars drive our future forward?
