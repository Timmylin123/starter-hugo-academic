abstract: Live entertainment is moving towards a greater participatory culture,
  with dynamic narratives told through audience interaction. Robot characters
  offer a unique opportunity to mitigate the challenges of creating personalized
  entertainment at scale. However, robots often cannot react to audience
  responses, limiting opportunities for audience participation. In this work, we
  explore methods to increase user agency in live entertainment experiences with
  robot characters to improve user engagement and enjoyment. In a
  between-subjects study (N=60), we create an immersive story where users
  role-play as detectives with two distinct robot characters. Users either (1)
  have greater involvement and self-identification in the story by talking with
  the robots in-character (narrative condition), (2) have a more active role in
  solving puzzles (gameplay condition), or (3) follow along without being
  prompted by the robots for input (control condition). Our results show that
  increasing user agency in a role-playing experience, in either its narrative
  or its gameplay, improves users' flow state, sense of autonomy and competence,
  verbal engagement, and perceptions of the robot characters' engagement.
  Increasing narrative agency also led to longer unprompted reactions from
  participants, while gameplay agency improved feelings of immersion and
  relatedness with the robots. These findings suggest that creating either
  narrative or gameplay agency can improve user engagement, which can extend to
  broader robot interactions where gameplay elements and role-playing in stories
  can be incorporated.
