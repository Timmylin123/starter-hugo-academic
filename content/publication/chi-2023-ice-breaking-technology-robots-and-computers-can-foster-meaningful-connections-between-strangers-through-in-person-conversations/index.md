abstract: Despite clear benefits to well-being, strangers in close physical
  proximity regularly ignore each other due to their tendency to underestimate
  the positive consequences of social connection. In a between-subjects study (N
  = 49 pairs, 98 participants), we investigated the effectiveness of a humanoid
  robot, a computer screen, and a poster at stimulating meaningful, face-to-face
  conversations between two strangers by posing progressively deeper questions.
  We found that the humanoid robot facilitator was able to elicit the greatest
  compliance to the deep conversation questions. Additionally, participants in
  conversations facilitated by either the humanoid robot or the computer screen
  reported greater happiness and connection to their conversation partner than
  those in conversations facilitated by a poster. These results suggest that
  technology-enabled conversation facilitators can be useful in breaking the ice
  between strangers, ultimately helping them develop closer connections over
  face-to-face conversations and enhance their overall happiness.
