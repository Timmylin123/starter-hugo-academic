title: "[RO-MAN 2022] Benefits of an Interactive Robot Character in Immersive
  Puzzle Games"
abstract: Robots are becoming increasingly prominent in the entertainment
  sphere, where they interact with guests in themed environments to tell
  stories, often in place of human characters. To evaluate the potential
  benefits of robots in these contexts compared to humans, we created an
  interactive puzzle game where either a robot or a human actor serves as a
  diegetic "game guide" character that is both a cooperative partner and an
  omniscient game master. In the game, participants solve a crime mystery by
  asking the game guide for information to complete tasks and for hints to solve
  puzzles. We conducted a between-subjects study (n=42) to investigate how
  players' game experiences differed when the game guide was a human compared to
  an embodied robot. Our results show that participants playing with a robot had
  more fun, felt less judged, and felt more connected with the robot while
  solving tasks compared to those playing with a human. These results suggest
  that robots can be effective alternatives to human actors in broader immersive
  entertainment contexts such as escape rooms to provide greater enjoyment and
  promote more social interaction with in-game characters.
