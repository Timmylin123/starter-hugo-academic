abstract: We introduce ThrowIO, a novel style of actuated tangible user
  interface that facilitates throwing and catching spatial interaction powered
  by mobile wheeled robots on overhanging surfaces. In our approach, users throw
  and stick objects that are embedded with magnets to an overhanging
  ferromagnetic surface where wheeled robots can move and drop them at desired
  locations, allowing users to catch them. The thrown objects are tracked with
  an RGBD camera system to perform closed-loop robotic manipulations. By
  computationally facilitating throwing and catching interaction, our approach
  can be applied in many applications including kinesthetic learning, gaming,
  immersive haptic experience, ceiling storage, and communication. We
  demonstrate the applications with a proof-of-concept system enabled by wheeled
  robots, ceiling hardware design, and software control. Overall, ThrowIO opens
  up novel spatial, dynamic, and tangible interaction for users via overhanging
  robots, which has great potential to be integrated into our everyday space.
