abstract: Despite the clear benefits that social connection offers to
  well-being, strangers in close physical proximity regularly ignore each other
  due to their tendency to underestimate the positive consequences of social
  connection. In a between-subjects study (N = 49 pairs, 98 participants), we
  investigated the effectiveness of a humanoid robot, a computer screen, and a
  poster at stimulating meaningful, face-to-face conversations between two
  strangers by posing progressively deeper questions. We found that the humanoid
  robot facilitator was able to elicit the greatest compliance with the deep
  conversation questions. Additionally, participants in conversations
  facilitated by either the humanoid robot or the computer screen reported
  greater happiness and connection to their conversation partner than those in
  conversations facilitated by a poster. These results suggest that
  technology-enabled conversation facilitators can be useful in breaking the ice
  between strangers, ultimately helping them develop closer connections through
  face-to-face conversations and thereby enhance their overall well-being.

summary: 
  We found that the humanoid robot facilitator was able to elicit the greatest compliance with the deep conversation questions. Additionally, participants in conversations facilitated by either the humanoid robot or the computer screen reported greater happiness and connection to their conversation partner than those in
  conversations facilitated by a poster. These results suggest that
  technology-enabled conversation facilitators can be useful in breaking the ice
  between strangers.
